It’s that time of year again. Rosters are shuffling, contracts are expiring, and team managers are frantically trying to figure out: “If we lose our star duelist, who the hell do we sign?”


Traditionally, this decision was made through scouting reports, scrims, and gut feelings. But what if we could do better? What if we could use data to find players who are genuinely similar in playstyle, not just in name recognition?


That’s exactly what I set out to explore using the Valorant Champions 2025 Paris tournament data. Spoiler: the results are pretty damn cool.
